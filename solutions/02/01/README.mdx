# Promise Cache

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-suspense/promise-cache" />

🧝‍♂️ I've made a <PrevDiffLink>couple of changes</PrevDiffLink>. I moved the
`getShip` call into the component itself so we can dynamically change which ship
we're looking at. I also added some buttons to allow us to do this from the UI.

But we've got a problem, and I've added a counter button to the UI so you can
reproduce the problem. Every time you click it, we're suspending again 😱 This
is because we don't have caching on our `getShip` function so every render
triggers a new fetch call.

👨‍💼 Yeah, this is far from optimal for our application. Could you add a little
cache for our `getShip` function so when it's called with the same ship name it
doesn't request the ship again and suspend?

When you're finished, you should be able to click the counter button as many
times as you like without suspending. Additionally, because of the cache, once
you've fetched the details for a ship, you should be able to switch back and
forth and it should be instant.

	If you want to reset the cache while you're working on this, simply refresh
	the page. We're not going to get into cache invalidation in this workshop.
