# Server Cache

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-suspense/server-cache" />

👨‍💼 As the user selects different ships, we cache the promise in our `getShip`
utility. But if they refresh the page, the cache is lost. Our ship data doesn't
change much so we could have the user's browser cache the ship details for a
while to make the data persist across page refreshes.

Please add a `Cache-Control` header to <InlineFile file="api.server.ts" />
for both our API endpoints.
