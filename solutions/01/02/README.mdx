# Error Handling

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-suspense/error-handling" />

👨‍💼 If the user has a bad network connection or something we want to handle that
error case gracefully. Please wrap the `ShipDetails` in an `ErrorBoundary` from
`react-error-boundary`.

You can test this out by changing the `shipName` to a ship that doesn't exist.
We also have a good fallback for you to use that 🧝‍♂️ Kellie made called
`ShipError`. Good luck!
